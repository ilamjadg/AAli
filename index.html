<p>A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood.
The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. 
<div>While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.</div>
Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.
Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognized in modern society for hundreds of years.</p>

<h5>(#section4) Section 4</h5> 
<p>Anton Chekhov understood that life was godless, random and cruel, good people suffered, and lazy mediocrities often flourished. Shying away from a neat narrative conclusion, he pioneered an effortlessly formless form which was almost unbearably lifelike. His work is peopled by brutish, ignorant peasants, pompous officials, frustrated wives and spineless husbands. And yet he was no moralist or writer with a message. He simply turned an exquisitely observed mirror on contemporary Russian society, and then left the reader to come to their own conclusions.</p></section>
